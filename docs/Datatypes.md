# Datatypes


## Date
Generates the data for the "Date" datatype. This is used to generate random data between the __min__ and __max__ values found in the __schemas__ field within the .yaml file.
<br>
The date that is generated is in the _ISO_8601_ format (YYYY-MM-DD). Which allows for better sorting of days.
<br><br> __Example of ISO_8601 format:__ 2021-12-02
<br><br>
## Number
Generates the data for the "Number" datatype. This is used to generate float based numbers, within the __min__ and __max__ range found  within the .yaml file. These numbers use the comma symbol "." for values after the comma.
<br>
The number that is generated is in the _float_ format, which allows for after comma decimals. 
<br><br> __Example of float format:__ 19.29
